              Hello, This is Mohamed Ijas, Currently doing post graduate studies
              in web development at Conestoga College, Kitchener, With a
              Bachelor's degree in information technology from SRM Valliammai
              Engineering, Chennai. I worked as a Systems Engineer after my
              bachelors at Infosys from September 2021 to August 2024,
              specializing in SAP Sales & Distribution (SD), SAP Material
              Management (MM), SAP GRC along with deep knowledge in ServiceNow
              and a limited knowledge in AWS. During my time at Infosys, I've
              provided L2 support for Mercedes-Benz in Japan, assuring smooth
              application performance and troubleshooting crucial issues along
              with excellent customer support. Moreover, my technical skills
              include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node Js, Figma which enable me to
              bridge the gap between development and support, resulting in
              efficient operations and smooth user experiences. I enjoy
              investigating technology and solving the technical issues and
              bugs, and I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can
              streamline workflows, identify fundamental problems, and improve
              system stability.
